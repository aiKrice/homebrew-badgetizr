## What is Badgetizr ?
Badgetizr is a tool that will add badges to your pull requests to increase your team's productivity. It is fully customizable and you can add (almost) as many badges as you want. With Badgtizr on your CI, you will be able to save time by:
- Stop adding a link to your ticket in the description of the PR if you add the id of it in the title of the PR.
- Reminding that some tasks are still missing to do in the PR.
- Stop adding a visual indicator if your PR is a WIP.
- Having a badge to know the status of the CI pipeline without having to click on it, scrolling down to the bottom of the page _(coming soon)_.

## Installation via Homebrew (MacOS)
For now, only Github Pull Requests are supported. You have to export the environment variables `GITHUB_TOKEN` such as:
```bash
export GITHUB_TOKEN="your_github_token"
```

Then you can run the configure script and the badgetizer script:
```bash
$ brew tap aiKrice/badgetizr
$ brew install aiKrice/badgetizr/badgetizr
# edit the .badgetizr.yml file to your needs
$ export GITHUB_TOKEN="your_github_token"
```

## Installation via Apt-Get (Linux)
Coming soon...

## Installation manually (for MacOS and Linux)
```bash
$ git clone https://github.com/aiKrice/badgetizr.git --branch master
$ cd badgetizr
$ ./configure
```
In the rest of the documentation, I will consider that you have installed the tool in your `$PATH` and remove the `.sh` extension from the binary name.

## Usage
```bash
$ badgetizr #[options]
```
To see the different options available, you can use the `--help` option:
```bash
$ badgetizr --help
```

## Configuration
By default, the configuration file used is `.badgetizr.yml`. You can also specify a configuration file to use by using the `-c` option.
```bash
$ badgetizer -c my_config.yml
```
You can look to the `.badgetizr.yml.example` file at the root of the repository to see the different configuration options available.

If you want to use an icon for your badge, you can use the `icon` option and specify the icon name (badge ci only). All icons are available at [simpleicons.org](https://simpleicons.org/).

## Badges

### Badge Ticket [![Static Badge](https://img.shields.io/badge/JIRA-GH--1234-blue?logo=jirasoftware&color=blue&labelColor=grey)](https://yourproject.atlassian.net/browse/badge)
#### Status
 `Disabled` by default.

#### Description 

The badge ticket is a badge that will be displayed on your pull request if you have a Jira ticket or a Youtrack ticket in your pull request title or overall, something you would like to extract from the pull request title.
To do so, you have to define a pattern that will be used to extract the data (ie: ticket id). This pattern will be used with the `sed` command with the `-n -E` options and the `p` flag and will extract the first occurrence of the pattern found in the string.

#### Configuration:
- `color`: The color of the badge (default: `blue`).
- `label`: The label of the badge (default: `JIRA`).
- `logo`: The logo of the badge (default: `jirasoftware`).
- `sed_pattern`: The pattern to use to extract the ticket id from the pull request title (default: `.*\(([^)]+)\).*`, will match something like `feat(ABC-123):  My Pull Request Title` -> `ABC-123`).
- `url`: The url of the badge (default: `https://yourproject.atlassian.net/browse/%s`, will be `https://yourproject.atlassian.net/browse/ABC-123`). You don't need to escape the `-` and ` ` characters, they will be automatically escaped.

### Badge Wip ![Static Badge](https://img.shields.io/badge/WIP-yellow?logo=vlcmediaplayer&logoColor=white)

#### Status
`Enabled` by default.

#### Description
The badge wip is a badge that will be displayed on your pull request if the pull request title contains the word `WIP` whatever the case.

### Badge Dynamic ![Static Badge](https://img.shields.io/badge/Task_2-Done-grey?label=Task%202&labelColor=grey&color=darkgreen)
#### Status
`Disabled` by default.

#### Description
The badge dynamic is a badge that will be displayed on your pull request if the pull request body contains a pattern. You can define multiple patterns and each pattern will be displayed with a badge.

#### Configuration:
- `color`: The color of the badge (default: `grey`).
- `label`: The label of the badge (default: `Task 2`).
- `value`: The value of the badge (default: `Done`).
- `labelColor`: The color of the label (default: `grey`).
- `color`: The color of the badge (default: `darkgreen`).

example:
```yaml
- pattern: "- [ ] Task 1"
  label: "Task 1"
  value: "Not done"
  color: "orange"
```
will display: ![Static Badge](https://img.shields.io/badge/Task_1-Not_done-orange) if the checkbox is not checked.

In this case you can also use this to display a badge if the checkbox is checked.
example:
```yaml
- pattern: "- [x] Task 2"
  label: "Task 2"
  value: "Done"
  color: "green"
```

will display: ![Static Badge](https://img.shields.io/badge/Task_1-Done-green) if the checkbox is checked.

You don't need to escape the `-` and ` ` characters, they will be automatically escaped.

⚠️ Beware currently the regex has limitations, it is not using sed regex but only bash regex by checking if the pattern is found in the string (like a `contains`). An [opened issue](https://github.com/aiKrice/homebrew-badgetizr/issues/5) has been created and you are welcome to contribute to fix this ❤️.

### Badge Base Branch ![Static Badge](https://img.shields.io/badge/Base_Branch-master-orange?labelColor=grey&color=red)

#### Status
`Enabled` by default.

#### Description
The badge base branch is a badge that will be displayed on your pull request to indicate the target branch of the pull request. The default value is `develop`.

#### CLI Parameters
- `--pr-destination-branch`: The base branch to use to compare the pull request to.

### Badge CI [![Static Badge](https://img.shields.io/badge/My_CI-Build_number-purple?logo=bitrise&logoColor=white&labelColor=purple&color=green)](https://www.google.com)
#### Status
 `Disabled` by default.

#### Description 
The `badge ci` is a badge that will be displayed on your pull request to indicate the status of the CI pipeline, the build number and the build url. Currently the status is **static** but it will be **dynamic** in a short future.

#### CLI Parameters:
- `--pr-build-number`: The build number of the CI pipeline.
- `--pr-build-url`: The build url of the CI pipeline.

#### Configuration:
- `color`: The color of the badge (default: `purple`).
- `label`: The label of the badge (default: `Bitrise`).
- `logo`: The logo of the badge (default: `bitrise`).

## Contributing

$ ./configure #optional, just for dependencies
$ ./badgetizer.sh
```

## Release (for maintainers)
